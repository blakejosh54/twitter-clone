A fully responsive Twitter/X-inspired UI built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

This project recreates core Twitter functionality and includes AI-simulated features - all built without a backend.
Be sure to click on your empty profile picture on the left side of the screen.
Try and use the bookmark icon on the post cards and the bookmark nav item either below your screen on mobile or to the left on desktop
Lastly check out the sparkle button towards the bottom left of the post cards for an "AI" summary of the post
